## Overview
This lab looks at the device trees in Linux and how they are used to control hardware through the linux kernel on boot.

### Questions 


> What is the purpose of the device tree?

The device tree is a data structure that the linux kernel interprets at boot time to interface with the onboard hardware of the device. This data structure allows you to control hardware through the command line and verify which mode the hardware is in- should it have various modes or options asscociated with it.
