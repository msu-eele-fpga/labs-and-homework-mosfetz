# LAB7

## Overview
This lab looks at controlling the FPGA outside of Quartus. We create an rbf file that the FPGA uses to boot automatically, we then use our virtual machine to compile a devmem code that writes to the registers on our led patterns wrapper. We verified this functionality using Putty. 

## Deliverables
